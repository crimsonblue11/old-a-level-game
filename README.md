# Old A-Level Game

This project (officially titled "FPS Test 3") was written by me as my final project for A-Level Computing. 

It is a very simple first-person shooter written using the Unity Engine. The objective is to knock as many blocks off the edge of the stage in as little time as possible.

The art is practically nonexistent, the game doesn't play very well, and there's a lot of bugs I never got around to fixing. Still, this project is very dear to me and we all have to start somewhere :-)

Maybe one day if I get bored I'll come back to this project and fix it up and add some stuff.
